# Javascript lab 1

## Overview 
Convert the information that you have about yourself into variables in Javascript.

## Instructions
1. Create a variable called `myFirstName` that contains your first name. `example: "Luffy"`
2. Create a variable called `myLastName` that contains your last name.
3. Create a variable called `myFullName` that contains both first and last name. Use the previously created variables to do this.👍
5. Create a variable called `myHobbies` that contains a **list** of your hobbies.  `example: eat, fight, get on the ship`
6. Create a variable called `currentStudent` that is a boolean (true or false) that says if you are a student or not. `example: false`
7. Create a variable called `myDream` that contains description about your dream.
8. Create a variable called `bestFriend` that contains the name of your closest friend.
9. Create a variable called `phoneNumber` that contains a phone number.
10. Create a variable called `favoriteMeal` that contains the name of your favorite meal, I already know it's Kunafa though😋.
11. Create a variable called `myBirthYear` that contains the year you were born.
12. Create a variable called `currentYear` that contains the current year.
13. Create a variable called `myAge` that will show your age. Use the previously created variables to calculate this. 
14. After you wrote all the above variables, look at them again. Are there any variables that won't be changing like your name? If there is then change them to `const`.

## Bonus
1. Print all variables in the console with meaningful description.

Hope you have fun coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
